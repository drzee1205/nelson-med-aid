# Deployment Plan

This document outlines the deployment strategy for the Nelson-GPT Progressive Web App (PWA), including the Supabase backend and the React frontend.

---

## 1. Supabase Backend Deployment

The Supabase backend is managed through a combination of the Supabase Dashboard and the Supabase CLI.

### Steps:
1.  **Project Setup:** The Supabase project is already set up and configured.
2.  **Schema Migrations:** Database schema changes are managed through migration files in the `supabase/migrations` directory. To apply migrations, use the Supabase CLI:
    ```sh
    supabase db push
    ```
3.  **Environment Variables:** Secure environment variables (e.g., `MISTRAL_API_KEY`, `ENCRYPTION_KEY`) should be configured in the Supabase project settings.

## 2. React Frontend Deployment

The React frontend is a static site built with Vite, which can be deployed to any static hosting provider.

### Steps:
1.  **Build the Application:** Generate the static assets for the frontend:
    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```
    This will create a `dist` directory with the optimized assets.
2.  **Deploy to a Hosting Provider:** Deploy the contents of the `dist` directory to a static hosting provider like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.

## 3. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

A CI/CD pipeline will be set up to automate the deployment process.

### Considerations:
*   **GitHub Actions:** A GitHub Actions workflow will be created to automatically build and deploy the frontend whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch.
*   **Supabase Migrations:** The CI/CD pipeline will also include a step to apply Supabase migrations to ensure the database schema is always up-to-date.
*   **Environment Management:** The pipeline will manage different environments (e.g., `staging`, `production`) to ensure that changes are tested before being deployed to production.

---

## 4. Monitoring

Monitoring will be set up to ensure the application is running smoothly and to identify any issues.

### Considerations:
*   **Uptime Monitoring:** Use a service like Uptime Robot to monitor the availability of the application.
